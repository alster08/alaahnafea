        </a>Hello! I am from Tampa Florida and I have lived there my entire life.
      You can imagine that the weather differences between New Hampshire and
      Florida was very shocking. Nonetheless, I survived... kinda! At Dartmouth
      I plan on pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Arabic Language
      and Literature. If time allows, I plan to also attain a minor in Mathematics
      <br>
      <br>
       I am facinated by programming and web development and I hope that I will be able quench
      those aspirations with DALI. My experience with programming and web
      development is not as extensive as I would like it to be. Currently, I have
      mastered a couple programming languages such as C, JAVA, MATLAB, and PYTHON! By the end
      of this year, I hope to have an exeptional understaining in version control,
      html, software development, and frameworks.
      <br>
      <br>

      Aside from programming, I am the feed chair for The Dartmouth Mountaneering
      Club. Climbing is a new passion that I discovered at Dartmouth! I am in the process
      of starting a Dartmouth Spikeball club on campus! Also, I devote
      a couple hours a week to tutoring MATH03 for the Academic Clearing
      House! I am factinated by world politics and I one day aspire to leave
      a global positive impact with the work that I do! Some of my other
      passions and interests incude but are certainly not limit to: Soccer, Tennis,
      Harry Potter, The Walking Dead (I am the biggest fan trust me), and more!
